How to set up your Discord Bot
=========================

# Get your own copy of this code
**On Glitch**
In the upper left hand corner of this window, click the "tutorialbot" name and select "remix this" from the dropdown. That will copy this program over to a new version and let you edit everything there, without disrupting the original code. 

**On GitHub**
Details later.

# Edit your code

Dive into tutorial.md for a quick tutorial on discord bots, then try editing the server.js file yourself! Don't forget to carefully edit your personal details in package.json.

# Host your code
If you are using Glitch for editing your code, this will be somewhat easier to start. Glitch will let you host your Discord Bot for free, but with a five minute inactivity timeout. It's a good starting point, but eventually you will want a more long-term hosting location like Heroku. 

# Link your bot to Discord Developers
