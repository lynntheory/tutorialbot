# What is Tutorial Bot
When PixieBomb and I started coding our first bot, we were working off of a dozen various googled documents, someone else's basic code, and praying we knew what we were doing. These days, a decent template for other coding projects isn't too hard to find. We wanted to provide a one-stop tutorial and template for new programmers and one-time "I just want a custom bot" hobbyists to get information on how to make a Javascript Discord Bot.

# Get Started
Start by reading over hosting.md and tutorial.md for details on how to set up your tutorialbot on Discord and a brief tutorial on JavaScript. Then, dive into server.js for highly commented code displaying a handful of basic Discord Bot functions.

Our first bot, LittleSmilerBot, was built using "Build a Discord Bot" code by [Greg Worrall](https://twitter.com/gregjwww) as a starting point. We would be remiss not to mention his work in our credits. Thanks Greg for your awesome base code.
